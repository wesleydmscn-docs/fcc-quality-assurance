## Quality Assurance

In the [Quality Assurance Certification](https://freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/), you'll learn how to write tests
with Chai to ensure your applications work the way you expect them to.

Then you'll build a chat application to learn advanced Node and Express
concepts. You'll also use Pug as a template engine, Passport for
authentication, and Socket.io for real-time communication between the server
and connected clients.
